"""Turn one photo into the DLAA frame contract DLSS expects.

This module is the whole trick, so it is worth stating plainly what it is doing.

DLSS 5's neural renderer is not an image model with an image input. It is an NGX
snippet that rides along on a DLSS Super Resolution evaluation — the RenoDX
add-on hooks ``NGX_D3D12_EVALUATE_DLSS`` and injects the neural pass there. To
run it on a photo we therefore do not "call DLSS 5"; we hand DLSS a frame that
looks like it came out of a game, in DLAA mode (render size == output size), and
let the add-on take it from there.

A DLAA evaluation wants colour, depth, motion vectors, and a jitter offset:

* **Colour** — the photo, sRGB-decoded to linear and stored as RGBA16F. Linear
  matters: the neural pass reasons about light transport, and feeding it gamma
  values makes it read shadows as mid-grey and over-lift them.
* **Depth** — see ``to_hardware_depth`` below.
* **Motion vectors** — zeros. Nothing moved between our identical frames, and
  claiming otherwise makes DLSS reject its own history and smear.
* **Jitter** — optional, and the one place where a still image can be made to
  behave like a real render. See ``halton``.
