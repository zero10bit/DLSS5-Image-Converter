"""Make a crash leave evidence, because a windowed build swallows all of it.

A PyInstaller ``--windowed`` app has no console, and ``main`` redirects stdout
and stderr to the null device so nothing that writes to them dies. The cost of
that is total silence on failure: an unhandled exception, or a native crash from
a bad DLL, ends the process with no message at all. Every bug report so far has
been the words "crashes to desktop" and nothing to act on.

This writes any crash - Python *or* native - to ``crash.log`` beside the app, and
shows the user where it is. Three layers, because they catch different things:

- ``faulthandler`` dumps a C-level stack on a hard crash (an access violation,
  the shape a clashing FFmpeg DLL takes). Python's own hooks never see those.
- ``sys.excepthook`` catches an unhandled exception on the main thread, which is
  what actually terminates the app.
- ``threading.excepthook`` catches one on a worker thread, which usually only
  kills the thread - but leaves a record of why a conversion silently stopped.
