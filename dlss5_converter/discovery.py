"""Find the user's DLSS 5 files on their own disk, and copy them in.

Most people arrive here having already made DLSS 5 work in a game. The files are
sitting in that game's folder; they just do not necessarily know where, or which
four matter. Asking them to go and find `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` by hand is the single
biggest thing standing between "downloaded it" and "it works".

The important part is not finding the files — it is finding them **together**.
A runtime from one source with an add-on from another is a common way to produce
*"NR is unavailable in this session"*, so this scores whole folders rather than
individual files and prefers a folder that has a complete matched set. That set
is, by construction, one the user's own GPU and driver already accept.

Nothing here downloads anything. It only looks at files the user already has.
