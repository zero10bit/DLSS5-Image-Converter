"""Drive the native DLSS harness over a line protocol.

The harness is a long-lived subprocess rather than one invocation per frame, and
that is a correctness requirement rather than an optimisation: DLSS's temporal
history lives inside the NGX feature handle. Re-launching per frame would reset
the accumulator every time and make ``frames > 1`` do exactly nothing.

Protocol, one line each way, UTF-8:

    <- READY <notes>
    -> FRAME <colour.bin> <jitter_x> <jitter_y> <reset 0|1>
    <- FRAME_OK <index>
    -> WRITE <out.bin>
    <- WRITE_OK <bytes>
    -> QUIT
    <- BYE

Paths are sent unquoted and may contain spaces — a release under
``C:\\Program Files`` does, and so does anything under a user name with a space
in it. The harness parses the fixed numeric fields off the *end* of the line for
exactly this reason, so a path is whatever precedes them. Do not add quoting
here without changing ``SplitTrailingFields`` in ``main.cpp`` to strip it.

Any line beginning ``ERROR `` aborts the run and is surfaced verbatim; the
harness has far more context about an NGX failure than we do.
