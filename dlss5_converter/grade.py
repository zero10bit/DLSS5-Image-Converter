"""A small colour grade applied to the finished image.

Deliberately *after* the neural pass, not before. Grading the input would change
what the model sees — the pass reasons about light transport, so lifting
exposure first changes the result rather than just the look — and every change
would cost a fresh harness launch. Grading the output is free, instant, and
undoable, which is what "this came out a bit washed out" actually needs.

Everything happens in **linear** light. Exposure and contrast applied straight to
sRGB values are the classic way to get muddy midtones and hue shifts in
saturated colour, because a stop of light is a multiply in linear and something
else entirely once the transfer curve is in the way.

All four controls are neutral at 0.0, and a fully neutral grade returns the
input untouched rather than round-tripping it through the transfer curve for
nothing.
