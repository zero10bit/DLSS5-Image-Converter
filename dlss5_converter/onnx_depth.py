"""Depth Anything V2 depth estimation through ONNX Runtime - no PyTorch.

A drop-in for :class:`depth_engine.DepthEngine` (same ``load`` / ``infer`` /
``is_downloaded`` surface) that runs the model exported by
``scripts/export_onnx.py``. This is what lets a release ship without the 2.7 GB
PyTorch download and without transformers: inference is ONNX Runtime, and
pre/post-processing is plain numpy replicating the DPT image processor.

Input is a fixed 518x518 square (see ``scripts/export_onnx.py`` for why the
export is not dynamic); the depth map is resized back to the source resolution
afterwards, exactly as the torch path does. The output contract is identical:
normalised inverse depth in [0, 1] where 1.0 is nearest, which is already the
reversed-Z layout DLSS expects.
