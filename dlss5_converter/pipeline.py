    idle time; here it is paid once and each frame costs only its evaluations.

    Every frame resets DLSS's temporal history. Motion vectors are zero — the
    contract says nothing moved — so carrying accumulation between two genuinely
    different frames would drag the previous image into this one wherever the
    scene changed. Consistency between frames comes from feeding identical
    settings and stable depth, not from shared history.

    `depth_frames`, when given, replaces depth estimation entirely with the
    renderer's own depth pass. That is the reason this mode can be temporally
    stable: an estimated depth map wobbles slightly frame to frame and the
    neural pass follows it, while a rendered depth pass does not move at all.
