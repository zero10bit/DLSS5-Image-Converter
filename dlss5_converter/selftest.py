"""Prove the runtime actually works, rather than merely appearing to.

Written because a frozen build can pass every startup check and still fail on the
first conversion: ``bootstrap.is_ready`` uses ``find_spec``, which *locates*
PyTorch without importing it, so a missing transitive dependency stays invisible
until something tries to use it.

Output goes to stderr, which a windowed build still writes to a redirect, so:
