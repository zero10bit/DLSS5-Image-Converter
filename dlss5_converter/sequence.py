"""Image sequences: finding them, and reading depth that came from a renderer.

Two jobs, both small, both easy to get subtly wrong.

**Finding the sequence.** Given one frame, work out which files belong with it.
Renderers name frames with a zero-padded counter — ``shot_0001.png`` — so the
rule is: split the trailing digits off the stem, and take every sibling that
matches the same prefix, the same digit width and the same extension. Digit
width matters: without it ``shot_1.png`` and ``shot_0001.png`` end up in the same
sequence, and a folder holding two renders at different padding silently
interleaves them.

**Reading supplied depth.** This is the whole reason sequence mode can be
temporally stable. Depth Anything is estimated per frame and wobbles slightly
between them; a depth pass out of Blender or Maya is geometrically exact and
rock steady, and feeding that instead removes the main source of flicker.

The catch is that nobody agrees which way up a depth map goes. This module
normalises to the one convention the rest of the pipeline uses — **near = 1.0,
far = 0.0**, the same as Depth Anything and the same as reversed-Z — and leaves
the choice of whether to flip to the caller, because it cannot be inferred
reliably and the app shows the result so a human can just look.
