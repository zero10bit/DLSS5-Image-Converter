Put your own DLSS 5 files in this folder.

THIS IS THE ONLY FOLDER YOU TOUCH. You do not copy anything into engine\.
The app copies what it needs from here into engine\ (next to dlss5_eval.exe)
automatically on first run, because that is where NVIDIA's NGX and ReShade load
their DLLs from. On the same drive the copy is a hard link, so it costs no extra
space. Never put dlss5_eval.exe in this folder - it ships in engine\ and stays
there. Anyone telling you to place files in both folders by hand is mistaken.

None of these ship with the app and it will not help you obtain them.

EASIEST WAY, if DLSS 5 already works in a game for you:
copy all four files out of that game's folder. They sit next to the game
executable, usually in bin\x64. A set that is already running on your card
is a set the add-on has accepted on your GPU and driver, which saves you
guessing about versions - and keeping them together matters, because mixing
a runtime from one source with an add-on from another is a common way to
get "NR is unavailable in this session".

  nvngx_dlssnr.dll        the DLSS 5 neural renderer (about 158 MB)
                          on an RTX 40-series card this must be the
                          RTX-40-patched build, not the raw one
  nvngx_dlss.dll          DLSS Super Resolution, from a Streamline
                          Production folder - the neural pass runs
                          inside a DLSS evaluation, so it is required
  renodx-dlss5.addon64    the RenoDX DLSS 5 ReShade add-on
  dxgi.dll                ReShade, renamed. If you already have ReShade
                          in a game, copy that game's bin\x64\dxgi.dll
                          here. Otherwise extract ReShade64.dll from the
                          ReShade installer and rename it to dxgi.dll.

You do not need to tidy any of this up:

  - a Streamline folder can stay unflattened; the app looks inside
    NVStreamline\Production too
  - a .zip can stay zipped. If nvngx_dlss.dll is missing the app opens any
    zip in this folder, pulls out what it needs, and leaves the rest alone.
    It never overwrites a file you put here yourself.

The app copies these next to engine\dlss5_eval.exe on first run, because that
is where NGX and ReShade look. Use Diagnose in the app to check what it found.

The default depth model (Depth Anything V2 Small, ONNX) ships inside the app, so
it works out of the box with no download.

Base and Large are not downloaded by the app. To use one, export it once from the
source tree (needs the "export" extra: torch + transformers) and drop the file in
onnx\ inside this folder:

    python scripts\export_onnx.py --model base --out <this folder>\onnx

If the selected model is missing the app says so in the status bar and uses Small.
Measured on this pipeline the depth plane does not change the neural result, so
Small is not a compromise.

Nothing here is required for the app to run. Rebuilding the app does not touch it.
