"""The main-thread half of every button.

Written after v0.1.15 shipped with Convert, Compare styles and Find my DLSS
files all raising AttributeError on the first click. A patch had inserted three
methods before "the first `_teardown`" in the file, which belonged to a dialog
rather than to MainWindow - so the methods existed, just on the wrong class, and
every one of the 142 tests passed.

Nothing here runs a conversion. Threads are stubbed, so what is exercised is
precisely the part that broke: the code a click runs on the UI thread before any
work starts. That is cheap to test and is where this class of mistake lands.
